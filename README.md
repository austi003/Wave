Wave
====

This is a problem one of our developers gave me to tackle in Ruby

The point of the problem is to take in a Wave file, read its DataChunk, and then figure out certain
things about the wave file such as the highest amplitude, lowest amplitude, etc.

From there, I then added features to prompt a user for different options, such as play normally, play in reverse
